Benchmark using application, requires that certain CPAN modules are
installed. Other requirements may also apply (benchmarks can be
disabled if they won't work on your platform/system).

Measures only run-times without doing any kind of correction, thus
results can only be compared between the different perls in the same
run. Running the same benchmark again might produce different results
outside of the error range.

Output is the average run-time with between brackets the error.
